  Admin can use the following commands:

  cash <player> - view a player's on-hand cash
  account/list <player> - view a player's account/list
  cargo/create - Create a new randomly generated cargo job
  cargo/edit <num>/<field>=<value> - Edit an existing cargo job

  Also:

  * Admin do not get checked for enough credits when they use 'pay'
  * Admin can deposit to accounts without having enough credits on-hand
  * Admin can view any account
  * Admin can change access for any account
  * Admin can close any acount
  * Admin can rename any account

  Keep in mind that your name is logged when you interact with accounts. For
  hacking and other direct account manipulations, contact Rince for now and once
  he gets tired of you bothering him he might write up some manipulation
  commands.
 
  For cargo jobs, the <num> is the number of the job.  The <field> is one of
  the editable fields, which are: grade, expires, size, price, visibility,
  source, destination, commodity.  Most are fairly self-explanatory, and the
  failure messages will give you instructions for the proper format.  However,
  for the 'expires' field, the format should <num> hours|days.  I.e., "10
  days" or "5 hours".
