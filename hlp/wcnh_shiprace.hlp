& RACES
Ship races are a prime gambling opportunity. Once per day at 6pm PST, the 
Sol Belt Racing League holds an epic contest of piloting skill in a 
race that traverses the Asteroid Belt.  The race is broadcast via IC comms on
channel 100.00. Players can wager on individual racers in a manner similar to
RL horse races.  The odds on the racers are updated in real time, and each
racer has a set of actual skills which are checked in comparison to determine a
winner.
 
The following commands are available:
 
race/history        race/purchase       race/record         race/roster
