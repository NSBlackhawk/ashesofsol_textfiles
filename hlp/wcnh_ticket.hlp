& +ticket
  AoS's +ticket system is your method as a player to create tasks or questions
  for the admin. You can use it to submit a bug report, make a request for
  something, note a typo, etc. All +tickets are only viewable by admin.

  The commands you need to know are:

  +ticket/open <subject>=<message> - opens a new +ticket. Please provide as 
    much information as you can about your question, bug, etc.
  +ticket/comment <ticket number>=<comment> - add a comment to an existing
    ticket.
  +ticket/list [page <#>] - list your tickets.
  +ticket/view <ticket number> - view a ticket.
  +ticket/reopen <ticket number> - reopen a closed ticket.
  +ticket/close <ticket number> - close a ticket.

  You will normally receive a @mail message when a +ticket you open is closed.
  +ticket/view to see the response notes, if any, and if you have any
  questions, please add them as a comment and use +ticket/reopen.
