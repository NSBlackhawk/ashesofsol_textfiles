& +BBOARD
Ash of Sol's Bulletin Board is a custom in-game system written
in Ruby which aims to provide the experience of using a web-based forum while
logged in to the game.  For the sake of simplicity, wherever it's possible the
command structure mimics the popular Myrddin BBS that has become a staple on
the majority of MU*s.  
 
For information on subscribing to boards and reading posts, see 'help bboard
reading'.
 
For information on writing posts, see 'help bboard writing'.

& BBOARD READING
& BBREAD
Reading a bulletin board requires that you subscribe to that board.  By default
every new player is automatically subscribed to every bulletin board they can
access.  If you want to unsubscribe or join additional boards, you can
use the "+bbleave" or "+bbjoin" commands, respectively.  You can use the
"+bblist" command to see all available boards, including the ones that you
aren't subscribed to.
 
Each post on the bulletin boards can have multiple replies, just like a
web-based forum.  The "+bbpost" and "+bbreplies" commands are used to post and
read replies.  When using the "bbnext" command to read your unread posts,
replies will automatically be included.
 
Bulletin board posts are considered Out-of-Character (OOC) information unless
specifically noted otherwise.  You can tell when a board contains In-Character
(IC) information because the name of the board will be prefixed with "IC".  For
example, "IC - Jupiter News Net".

& BBOARD WRITING
& BBOARD POSTING
& BBPOST
Writing a bulletin board post is as easy as sending email or writing a post on
a web-based forum.  When writing a bboard post, keep in mind that some bulletin
boards are Out-of-Character (OOC) and some are In-Character (IC).  The boards
that are IC will have "IC" in their name.  For example, "IC - Jovian Confederacy
News".  Please refrain from posting IC information on boards that are not
IC.
 
If you prefer to write a post using a single command, you can use the "+bbpost"
command.  The same command also allows you to start a draft which you can edit
in sections at your convenience.  The same command also command allows you to
reply to your own or someone else's post.
