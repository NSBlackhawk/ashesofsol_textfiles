& ROLEPLAY
Roleplaying is the meat and potatoes of our game.  It's the primary reason why
we're all here.  All of the fancy code exists primarily to support and
facilitate roleplaying.  The topics in this section are for handling the most
common situations that may occur while you're roleplaying with other players.
 
Topic     Summary
+XP       How do I earn experience and advance my character?
COMBAT    How do I resolve conflicts with other players?
PRIVACY   How do I roleplay privately with one or more people?
+LOG      How can I conveniently log my roleplaying scenes?
 
Type 'help <topic>' for more information on each topic.

& PRIVACY
There are some situations where you may want to roleplay privately with other
characters without being interrupted.  Perhaps you're a criminal planning a
heist, or maybe you just want to talk about someone behind their back.  These
topics will help you accomplish just that.
 
Topc      Summary
PLACES    What are virtual places and how can I use them for privacy?
LOCK      How can I lock or unlock entire rooms?
 
Type 'help <topic>' for more information on each topic.

& SOCIAL
Playing on any MUSH is a social experience, and WCNH is no different.  We
provide a number of methods for communicating and interacting with your fellow
players.  The important point to remember is that some routes of communication
are In-Character (IC) and others are Out-of-Character (OOC).  The help files on
most commands will specify whether a command is IC or OOC, but a good rule of
thumb to remember is that if a command is prefixed with a '+', like '+bbread',
it's OOC.  If a command is not prefixed with a '+', like 'message', then it's
IC.
 
Type 'help <topic>' for more information on each topic.

  Topic     Summary
  COMMS     How do I talk to other characters using communicators?
  +BBOARD   How do I use the in-game forums and bulletin boards?
  CALENDAR  How can I plan and attend game-related events?
  FACTIONS  How can I join or create a group of like-minded characters?
  +OOC      How can I talk OOCly to people in the same room?
  +TICKET   How can I make requests to the administrators?
  CHANNELS  How can I chat OOCly as I would in a chat room?
 
Continued in 'help social2'

& SOCIAL2
In addition to the previously mentioned topics, there are some commands that
you may find useful for obtaining basic OOC information about specific people
or the game at large.
 
  Topic     Summary
  +WHO      How can I see everyone that's online?
  +FINGER   How can I get summary information on someone?
  +STAFF    How can I see a list of administrators?
  +GUIDES   How can I see a list of player guides?
  +911      How can I get an administrator's attention for an emergency?
  TIME      How can I check the In-Character date and time?
  +WHERE    How can I find out where other players are?

better, please open a +ticket (see: 'help +ticket') and we'll check it out.

& wanted
  wanted
  wanted <entry number>
 
  This command allows you to view the IC 'wanted' information, jointly published
  by the Enigma Sector Consortium & the Kilrathi Commonwealth.
 
  This information is fully IC and may be acted upon, however, please remember
  that just because you see another player in a room with you, you may not know
  who they are, or be able to recognize them.
   
  In order to turn in a bounty for credits once you have tracked it down and
  captured it, simply open a +ticket with the details, or alternatively use
  +911 if it's a time-sensitive scene.
   
  See additional help on: +911, +ticket

& +log
  On WCNH, by default, all roleplay poses, emits, etc are logged. This is for
  several reasons: #1, to reward players with XP, +noms, and other perks based
  on the amount they roleplay, and #2, to allow players and staff to retrieve
  logs easily, both after scenes and in real-time, eliminating the need for
  "re-poses".
 
  There may be instances where you might wish to temporarily disable this
  logging. You will not receive any XP or other game benefits for any poses
  while logging is disabled and will not be able to retrieve logs of disabled
  poses. You will also be periodically reminded you have logging disabled.
 
  Note that, as outlined in our TOS, we recommend truly private/confidential
  OOC matters to be handled off-game. ('help terms of service2')
 
  Commands:
  +log/off - Disable logging of your poses/emits/etc.
  +log/on - Re-enable logging.
  +log/last - View the last 5 poses you've seen, whether yours or not.
  +log/last page <#> - View more pages of poses you've seen.
& contract
  The contract system represents the IC process that both the Consortium and
  Commonwealth (unified under 'Enigma Sector Procurement') go through when they
  have large jobs that need to be handled by an outside contractor. It's similar
  to many real-world 'RFP'/procurement processes.

  The contract system is used for all sorts of contract jobs, big and small.

  Every contract has both background information and a set of questions. To bid
  on a contract, you need to answer all of the questions on behalf of yourself
  or your org, and then submit the response prior to the contract closing to new
  bids. Responses will not be considered until they are submitted.

  Contracts will be awarded within a few days of their close date, and the
  "winner" is normally announced publically via the Procurement +bboard.

  Commands:
  contract/list - List all open and recently closed contracts.
  contract <job #> - View details of a contract.
  contract/answer <job #>/<question #>=<answer> - Record your answer to a 
                                                  contract question.
  contract/response <job #> - View your response to a contract.
  contract/submit <job #> - Submit your completed response. Once submitted, you
                            cannot change your answers.

& LOCK
Syntax: lock <exit>
        unlock <exit>
        lock/add <exit>=<player>
        lock/remove <exit>=<player>
 
These commands allow characters to manipulate the locks on any doors they
control. By default, a character controls a door if they are the captain of the
ship the door is on, or if they have been added to the permissions list for a
lock (via the lock/add command).  
 
If you believe you should have control of locks in an area, request access in a
+ticket.  Alternatively, if you'd like to try to hack the locks for a
particular door, you can request a GM with the +911 command.
