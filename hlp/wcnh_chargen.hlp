& chargen
  These files are designed to ease you through the character generation 
  process as easily as possible. You can always ask on channel <Help> for 
  assistance. It is recommended that you read over all these chargen files 
  before beginning the process, to avoid having to start over.

& chargen overview
  If you're not familiar with a 'chargen' system, it's a common term for a MUSH
  system to help design your character - his or her abilities, skills, traits,
  and so on. The process is very similar to that used in pen-and-paper RPGs.

  AoS's system is based on the FUDGE tabletop system, with adaptations and
  customizations for MUSH use.

  As a new player, you will need to complete chargen before you can begin role-
  playing. Don't worry, it doesn't take very long.

  Your character will have two classes of abilities: ATTRIBUTES and SKILLS.
  You have six attributes that represent big-picture capabilities.  
  Each of these attributes has a number of skills based on it. These represent
  specific abilities, things you can be trained on, and so on. They are:

  REAson - your ability to solve mental challenges, learn and retain knowledge
  STRength - your pure physical power and brute force abilities
  PERception - your ability to notice things around you and engage socially
  AGIlity - your physical mobility, dexterity, and coordination
  WILlpower - your inner strength, resolve, and determination
  HEAlth - your vitality and overall hardiness

  Type 'help chargen overview2' to continue.
& chargen overview2
  Both attributes and skills are rated on a simple scale. Like many RPG
  systems, it is numbers-based, but it also has adjectives attached (for
  example, a 4 is 'Good'). You can type '+values' to view the scale.

  Typing '+sheet' will show you your attributes and skills. Most skills
  have a base, which you can see via '+skillinfo <skill>'. For example, 
  Astrogation has a base of REA-2; if your REAson is Good (4), that skill will
  be Mediocre (2).

  Some skills are complex and don't have a base; those skills will start at 
  Awful (0) for everybody.

  In chargen, you will be able to add levels to your skills. Continuing the
  example above, if you spend points in chargen to get a +2 in Astrogation,
  you'd then have it at Good (4).

  Once your skills and attributes are set, you can roll them using '+check'.
  See 'help +check' for info. Some game systems will auto-+check for you.

  As you walk through chargen, the helpfile for each room will give you the
  commands necessary. There are also several global commands that can be used
  outside of chargen.

  To start chargen, look for the 'chargen' exit in the new player area.
  Don't be afraid to ask for help at any point via the <Newbie> channel - just
  type '+new <message>'.

  Type 'help chargen commands' to see the list of global chargen commands.
& chargen commands  
  These are the global commands that interface with 
  the chargen system.  For information on the commands used IN chargen 
  itself, see 'help chargen room'.

  COMMANDS:

  +check         +sheet         +skillinfo     +values   

  Type 'help <entry>' for information on each command.
& +check
  +check[/private] <skill|attribute>[=<player list>]

  This command runs a skill or attribute check, rolling the dice to see how
  your character does at a task using that skill or attribute. A +check
  consists of your base value in that attribute or skill, with a random number
  between -2 and +2 added. For example, if your Astrogation skill is Good (4),
  a '+check Astrogation' will always be between Mediocre (2) and Superb (6).

  +checks are visible to everyone in the same room. If you don't want to spam
  everybody, use +check/private.
 
  When using the /private switch, specifying an optional list of players will
  show the results of your check only to those players.

  +sheet

  +sheet shows you your character's attributes and skills.

  Note that the skill groups are cosmetic only and do NOT reflect the base
  attribute. Use '+skillinfo' to see that information.

& +skillinfo
  +skillinfo <skill>

  This command shows you information on a skill.

  and their adjective descriptions.

& chargen room
  For information on each room of chargen type 'help chargen room 1', 'help
  chargen room 2', and so on.
& chargen room 1
Welcome aboard! This help file will help you through the first room.
The commands you'll need here are:
 
+set age <AGE>
You can't be over 85 or under 18. Note that we use 'human years' here.
 
+set race <RACE>
Choose a race. Valid races at the moment are are Jovian, Lunarian, Martian, 
Saturnian, Urian, and Spacer.  However, during the time, only Jovians, 
Lunarians, Urians, and Spacers will be open for application.
 
+set concept <CONCEPT>
Your 'concept' is a one-or-two sentence summary of your character. We make you
write this first because then you can keep it in mind for the rest of chargen,
which really helps the process (believe it or not). Example: 'A neophyte
merchant trader. Young, impressionable, but determined to make his mark on the 
galaxy.'
 
+set name <firstname> <lastname>
You need a full name.  Middle name is not mandatory.
 
+set gender <Male|Female>
I dearly hope this is self-explanatory.
 
+set alias <alias>
An alias is a short form of your name, something easier to type than the full
thing. It must be 5 letters or less.

+set tz <UTC/GMT offset>
This allows you to set your local timezone relative to GMT. For example,
Eastern Standard Time is -5, Pacific Standard Time is -8, and so on.

onwards
Once you've set all the above, type 'onwards' to move to the next room.
& chargen room 2
This room allows you to set your skills and attributes. Make sure and read 
'help chargen overview' first or you will be totally lost.

If you type 'look', you'll see your remaining skill points and attribute
levels.

Increasing attributes is straightforward - spend an attribute level to increase
an attribute. You can also lower your starting attributes to raise other 
attributes, if desired.

Raising a skill from 0 to 1 costs 1 point. Every level beyond that costs that
level, minus one. So 1 to 2 costs 1 point, 2 to 3 costs 2 points, and so on.

An attribute can never be lower than 1 or higher than 6.
A skill can never be lower than 0 or higher than 6 (total score, not +6).
 
+sheet
Displays all your skills and attributes. See 'help +sheet'.

+raise <skill|attribute>
Raises a skill or attribute, if you've got the attribute levels/skill points.

+lower <skill|attribute>
Lowers a skill or attribute.

onwards
Once you've set all the above, type 'onwards' to move to the next room.
& chargen room 3
In room 3, you'll set your background and do a few housekeeping items. Your
background is a description of your character's life prior to you starting to
tell his or her story "live" on the game; their childhood, upbringing, and so
on.

We use a simple question-based system to help you get your background done
quickly, and there's no waiting for approval. If you write something that's
out of whack with the universe we're trying to roleplay in, an admin will let
you know.

The commands are:

+bg/questions
List all the questions we need answered. Optional questions are not required,
but you're encouraged to answer them.

+bg/answer <question>=<text>
Answers a question. Pages of text aren't really needed, but a few sentences
would be nice.

+bg/question <number>
Review your answer to a question.

+bg
Review all of the answers you've given. This command works outside of chargen
too, in case you ever need to review what you answered.

@desc me=<description>
Write a description of your character; what he/she looks like physically,
typical posture/attitude, clothing and accessories/personal items, and so on.

onwards
Once you've set all the above, type 'onwards' to move to the next room.
& chargen room 4
Almost done. There's only a few things to do here.
